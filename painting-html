    <h2>Document Size and Resolution</h2>
    <p>When creating your new document in photoshop, there are several things to keep in mind. Making sure that your document will be able to be sent to print when it is completed is a must. Printing requires your image document to have a resolution of 300. It is always good practice to work with a larger canvas and if you need to size it down later on, you can do so. It is always possible to shrink the image size down later for print, but the reverse is not possible.</p>
